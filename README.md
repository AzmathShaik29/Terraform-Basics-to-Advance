# Terraform Basics to Advance

## Day 1: Introduction to Terraform

#### Getting Started with Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

I will introduce you to the core concepts of Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). Discover the importance of Terraform in infrastructure management and how IaC simplifies provisioning.

#### Installing Terraform on MacOS, Linux and Windows

Dive in and install Terraform on macOS, Linux, and Windows. I will provide step-by-step instructions and commands to guide you through the process.

#### Configuring Terraform for AWS

Explore AWS integration with Terraform. Learn how to set up your AWS credentials and configure the AWS provider to begin provisioning resources.

#### Creating Your First Terraform Configuration

Begin writing Terraform code with a simple example. Explore the basic structure of a Terraform configuration file and learn how to define resources using HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL).

#### Terraform Workflow and Lifecycle

Learn the Terraform lifecycle by exploring key commands like init, plan, and apply. Understand their roles in initializing configurations, planning changes, validating and applying infrastructure updates.

#### Deploying an EC2 Instance with Terraform

Level up your skills by provisioning an EC2 instance on AWS with Terraform. Learn how to customize your instance using attributes like instance type, AMI, region, key pair and tags.

#### Understanding Terraform State File Basics

Discover the importance of Terraform state files. Learn how Terraform tracks the desired and current states to maintain infrastructure consistency and ensure smooth management.

## Day 2: Advanced Terraform Configuration

#### Exploring Providers and Resources

Enhance your understanding of providers and resources. Learn how providers connect Terraform to various cloud platforms, and see how resources are used to define specific infrastructure components within your configurations.

#### Working with Variables and Outputs in Terraform

Unlock the potential of variables for creating dynamic and flexible configurations. Understand how to define, declare, and use variables efficiently. Dive into outputs to extract and display key information from your infrastructure.

#### Using Conditional Expressions and Functions in Terraform

Enhance your Terraform configurations with conditional expressions to incorporate logic into your code. Explore Terraform’s built-in functions for operations such as string manipulation, arithmetic, and more.

## Day 3: Building Reusable Infrastructure with Terraform Modules

**Creating Modular Infrastructure with Terraform Modules**

Harness the power of modularity by breaking down your infrastructure into reusable, organized components. Learn how to define and structure Terraform modules for consistency and portability across environments.

**Local Values and Data Sources**

Simplify your configuration by using local values to reduce repetition and improve readability. Gain hands-on experience with data sources to dynamically retrieve and reference existing infrastructure or external information—enhancing flexibility and adaptability.

**Using Variables and Inputs with Modules**

Dive into variable-driven modules to customize behavior and increase module reusability. Understand how to define input variables within modules and pass dynamic values from the root configuration to make your infrastructure more scalable and configurable.

**Leveraging Outputs from Modules**

Make your modules more informative by defining output values. Learn how to expose key resource attributes from modules to your root configuration, enabling seamless integration between different parts of your infrastructure.


## Day 4: Collaboration and State Management

**Understanding Terraform Backends**

Explore the importance of Terraform backends in managing remote state. Learn how backends help maintain infrastructure consistency, enable collaboration, and ensure secure storage of the Terraform state file.

**Configuring S3 as a Remote Backend**

Gain practical experience in setting up an Amazon S3 bucket for storing Terraform state remotely. Discover how using S3 enhances team collaboration, provides versioning, and centralizes state management across environments.

**Enabling State Locking with DynamoDB**

Understand the concept of state locking to prevent simultaneous changes to infrastructure. Implement DynamoDB for state locking, ensuring that your Terraform operations are consistent and protected from race conditions during deployments.

## Day 5: Environment Management Using Terraform Workspaces

Master the use of Terraform workspaces to efficiently manage multiple environments such as development, staging, and production. Learn how workspaces help isolate state files, allowing you to deploy the same infrastructure code to different environments without overwriting configurations.

**Introduction to Terraform Workspaces**

Gain insight into Terraform workspaces and their purpose in handling multiple environments. Understand how they help isolate infrastructure configurations for better environment segregation.

**Creating and Switching Between Workspaces**

Discover how to create and navigate between different workspaces using ```terraform workspace``` commands. Learn the importance of these actions in organizing environment-specific deployments.

**Leveraging Workspaces for Environment Management**

Explore how workspaces enhance environment management by maintaining separate state files. Understand their advantages in preventing configuration conflicts across development, staging, and production setups.

## Day 6: Security Best Practices and Advanced Concepts

Delve into security considerations and advanced Terraform features. Learn how to secure your infrastructure code and explore powerful functionalities that enhance your deployments.

**Introduction to HashiCorp Vault**

Explore the fundamentals of HashiCorp Vault, a robust solution for managing secrets and protecting sensitive data. Understand how it helps enforce security best practices in your infrastructure.

**Secure Secret Management with Vault and Terraform**

Discover how to integrate Terraform with Vault to handle secrets efficiently. Learn how Vault enables secure storage and dynamic retrieval of sensitive configuration data during deployments.

# **Providers**

In Terraform, a **provider** is a plugin that allows Terraform to communicate with various APIs, including those from **cloud platforms, SaaS services**, and other infrastructure tools. Providers are declared in your Terraform configuration and inform Terraform which services or platforms it should interact with.

For instance, if you're provisioning a virtual machine on **AWS**, you would use the ```aws``` provider. This provider gives Terraform access to a collection of AWS resources that it can manage—allowing you to **create**, **update**, and **destroy** infrastructure components such as EC2 instances, S3 buckets, VPC, Subnets and more.

Here’s a basic example of how to configure and use the aws provider in a Terraform setup:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
}
```

In below expample we are using one of the ```AWS``` resource:

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region     = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0" # Change the AMI as per your need (ubuntu, linux, windows)
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

In this example, we start by defining the ```aws``` provider and setting the region to ```us-east-1```. Next, we define an ```aws_instance``` resource, where we specify the **AMI ID** and **instance type**.

When Terraform runs, it performs the following steps:

1. Installs the AWS provider if it’s not already available.
2. Uses the provider to interact with AWS and provision the specified virtual machine based on the configuration.

This setup allows Terraform to manage the lifecycle of the EC2 instance—creating, updating, or destroying it as defined in your configuration.

Below are few providers:

- `azurerm` - for Azure
- `google` - for Google Cloud Platform
- `kubernetes` - for Kubernetes
- `openstack` - for OpenStack

# Various Ways to Configure Providers in Terraform
Terraform offers multiple methods for configuring providers based on your use case. Here are the three primary approaches:

1. In the Root Module
2. Within a Child Module
3. Using the ```required_providers``` Block

**In the Root Module**

This is the most common method. The provider block is defined in the root module, making it accessible to all resources in the configuration.

```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
**Within a Child Module**

Providers can also be configured within child modules. This approach is useful when reusing provider configurations across multiple resources or environments.

```bash
module "aws_vpc" {
  source = "./aws_vpc"
  providers = {
    aws = aws.us-west-2
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on    = [module.aws_vpc]
}
```
**Using the required_providers Block**

This method is ideal for enforcing specific provider versions. It ensures Terraform uses a defined version from a particular source.

```bash
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = {
      source  = "hashicorp/aws"
      version = "~> 3.79"
    }
  }
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

Choosing the Right Approach

- Use the root module for simplicity when working with a single provider.
- Opt for child module configuration when managing complex environments or multiple providers.
- Use the required_providers block to lock down provider versions for stability and reproducibility.

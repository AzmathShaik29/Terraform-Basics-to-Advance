Before Terraform and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools, provisioning infrastructure was largely manual or involved custom scripts, making the process time-consuming and error-prone. Here’s how infrastructure was managed before Terraform and why it was challenging:

1. Manual Provisioning 🛠️
System administrators would log into cloud consoles or physical servers and manually create and configure resources.

This approach was slow, inconsistent, and required extensive documentation to repeat configurations.

2. Imperative Scripting (e.g., Shell, Python, Ansible, CloudFormation) 💻
Some automation was possible through custom scripts (e.g., Bash, Python) or configuration management tools like Ansible, Puppet, Chef, or AWS CloudFormation.

These tools required step-by-step instructions (imperative approach), which made scaling and managing dependencies harder.

3. Challenges Without Terraform 🚧

❌ Time-Consuming & Error-Prone – Manual processes led to inconsistencies and human errors.

❌ Difficult to Scale – Deploying large-scale infrastructure was complex without automation.

❌ Lack of Version Control – No way to track infrastructure changes efficiently.

❌ Dependency Management Issues – Ensuring resources were created in the right order was difficult.

❌ Harder Multi-Cloud Support – Managing infrastructure across different cloud providers required separate tools and knowledge.

### Why Terraform?
Terraform is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool that enables users to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language.
It automates infrastructure management, improves consistency, and enhances scalability across cloud and on-prem environments.


There are multiple reasons why Terraform is used over the other IaC tools but below are the main reasons.

✅ **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform allows infrastructure to be defined in code, making it easier to version, review, and reuse configurations.

✅ **Multi-Cloud Support:** It supports various cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, and even on-prem solutions, providing flexibility in managing infrastructure.

✅ **Declarative Configuration:** Users define what they want (desired state), and Terraform figures out how to achieve it, reducing manual effort.

✅ **State Management:** Terraform keeps track of infrastructure changes through its state file, ensuring consistency across deployments.

✅ **Modularity & Reusability:** With features like modules, Terraform enables reusable and scalable infrastructure components.

✅ **Dependency Management:** Terraform automatically handles resource dependencies, ensuring that resources are created or destroyed in the correct order.

✅ **Execution Plan (terraform plan):** Before applying changes, Terraform provides a preview, reducing the risk of unintended modifications.

✅ **Automation & CI/CD Integration:** It integrates well with DevOps pipelines, enabling continuous deployment of infrastructure.

✅ **HCL Language:** Terraform uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is designed specifically for defining infrastructure.
It's human-readable and expressive, making it easier for both developers and operators to work with.

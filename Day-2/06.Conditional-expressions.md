# Conditional Expressions in Terraform
Terraform's conditional expressions provide a way to include logic in your configurations. They let you decide what values to assign or whether to create resources based on specific conditions.

Basic Syntax:
```bash
condition ? true_value : false_value
```
- condition: An expression that results in true or false.
- true_value: Value used if the condition is true.
- false_value: Value used if the condition is false.

## ✅ Example 1: Conditional Resource Creation
```bash
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  count = var.create_instance ? 1 : 0

  ami           = "ami-a0123456789abcdef0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```
In this case, the EC2 instance is only created if the create_instance variable is true. If it’s false, the resource count is 0, meaning no instance will be created.

## ✅ Example 2: Conditional Variable Usage

```bash
variable "environment" {
  description = "Environment type"
  type        = string
  default     = "development"
}

variable "production_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for production subnet"
  default     = "10.0.1.0/24"
}

variable "development_subnet_cidr" {
  description = "CIDR block for development subnet"
  default     = "10.0.2.0/24"
}

resource "aws_security_group" "example" {
  name        = "example-sg"
  description = "Example security group"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = var.environment == "production" ? [var.production_subnet_cidr] : [var.development_subnet_cidr]
  }
}
```
Here, the cidr_blocks value changes based on the environment. If the environment is ```"production"```, the production CIDR block is used. Otherwise, the development CIDR block is applied.

Conditional expressions are powerful tools to make your Terraform code flexible and environment-aware.

# Implementing Multi-Region Infrastructure in Terraform

Terraform allows you to deploy resources across multiple regions by using the alias keyword within provider configurations.

```bash
provider "aws" {
  alias = "us-east-1"
  region = "us-east-1"
}
provider "aws" {
  alias = "ap-south-2"
  region = "ap-south-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "Terraform" {
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdefd"
  subnet_id = "subnet-094dab12d07f3456"
  key_name = "abckey"
  provider = "aws.us-east-1"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}

resource "aws_instance" "Terraform1" {
  instance_type = "t3.micro"
  ami = "ami-0123456789abcdef0"
  provider = "aws.ap-south-2" 
}
```

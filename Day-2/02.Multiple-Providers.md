# Working with Multiple Providers in Terraform
Terraform allows you to manage resources across different platforms by using multiple providers within a single project. Hereâ€™s how you can set it up:

1. Create a providers.tf File

Start by creating a ```providers.tf``` file in the root of your Terraform project to hold your provider configurations.

2. Define Multiple Providers

Inside providers.tf, you can define configurations for different providers, like AWS and Azure:
```bash
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}

provider "azurerm" {
  subscription_id = "your-azure-subscription-id"
  client_id       = "your-azure-client-id"
  client_secret   = "your-azure-client-secret"
  tenant_id       = "your-azure-tenant-id"
}
```
3. Use Providers in Resource Definitions

Now you can use both providers in your configuration files to manage resources across cloud platforms:
```bash
resource "aws_instance" "Sachin" {
  ami           = "ami-0123456789abcdef0" # Replace with your AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro" # Replace with your required instance type
}

resource "azurerm_virtual_machine" "Rahul" {
  name                  = "example-vm"
  location              = "eastus"
  resource_group_name   = "your-resource-group"
  network_interface_ids = ["your-nic-id"]
  vm_size               = "Standard_A1"
  # additional configuration...
}
```
Using multiple providers allows you to orchestrate infrastructure across multiple clouds or services from a single Terraform project, enabling powerful hybrid or multi-cloud deployments.
